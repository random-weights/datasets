# Datasets for Benchmark!

All research papers use these data-sets along with others for bench-marking their new strategies against the older ones. In each sections below, I have given links to download the dataset. 


## CIFAR-100

- Download dataset from: [HERE](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz)
- Extract the tar ball.
- replace file name in for_CIFAR in 2 locations:
	- line 11, this is the file in the tar ball extract
	- line 23, this is the name of your output file.
